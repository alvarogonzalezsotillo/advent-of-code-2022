This is my code for the [[https://adventofcode.com/2022][advent of code 2022]]

The code can be run with [[https://ammonite.io/][ammonite]], a script runner for [[https://www.scala-lang.org/][Scala]]. I prefer ammonite over scala+sbt for the simplicity of installation, dependencies and execution.

You can install ammonite with:

#+begin_src sh
sudo sh -c '(echo "#!/usr/bin/env sh" && curl -L https://github.com/com-lihaoyi/Ammonite/releases/download/2.5.5/2.13-2.5.5) > /usr/local/bin/amm && chmod +x /usr/local/bin/amm' && amm
#+end_src
